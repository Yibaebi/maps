## #Project Description

This is a basic practice typescript project. Maps is a simple JavaScript web application which **randomly generates** two entities - A _User_ and a _Company_. Both entities would have respective location properties (longitude and latitudes) assigned to them. The end goal of <mark>Maps</mark> is to display the locations of these randomly generated entities on a google map.
